After much thought, they narrow their options down to New York, New York, and Miami, Florida, but they still can't agree on which location would attract the most clients. \n\n### They also want to consider how much spending the location would require and which location poses the least risk to their financial future.

In order to determine which location will attract more clients, we need to know not only the population of each city's neighborhoods but also the average income in those locations. \n\n### *Avg Cost of Living*: We can also use data about the average cost of living there to help determine if people living there will be able to afford the brand. We analyze average apartment rent and housing costs, transportation spendings, groceries spendings, amongst other similar factors. \n\n### *Existing Businesses*: We also look at the number of businesses already in that location and what type of business they are, to determine how much competition there would be. \n\n### *Retail Sales*: Finally, we look at total retail sale numbers and retail sales per capita to see how much people spend in the area (on average)."
